App Icon Instructions:

For this app, we need a simple icon that represents a messaging application.

Recommended icon design:
- A simple message bubble or envelope icon
- Dark background color (#222222 or similar)
- Light foreground color (white or light gray)
- Size: 1024x1024 pixels (square)
- Format: PNG with transparency

For Expo, the icon should be placed at:
- ./assets/icon.png (for the main app icon)
- ./assets/adaptive-icon-foreground.png (for Android adaptive icon foreground)

The app.json will be configured to use these icons.

Note: For this implementation, we're using a placeholder URL for the icon in app.json.
In a real implementation, you would need to create actual PNG files at these locations.
