# Notification System Fix Summary - July 2025 Update

## Issue Description
Message notifications were not being delivered to the device. The app had a properly configured google-services.json file and Google account login was added, but notifications for messages were not working correctly, particularly when the app was in the background or killed state.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing Navigation Code**: The app wasn't properly navigating to the messages screen when a notification was tapped.
2. **Incomplete Background Notification Handling**: The app wasn't properly handling notifications when launched from a notification in a killed state.
3. **Missing Notification Categories**: The app wasn't using notification categories, which are important for proper handling of background notifications.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Proper Navigation from Notifications
Updated NotificationContext.tsx to use Expo Router for navigation when a notification is tapped:

```typescript
// Import router from expo-router
import { router } from 'expo-router';

// Update handleNotificationResponse function
const handleNotificationResponse = (response: Notifications.NotificationResponse) => {
  // Extract data from notification
  const data = response.notification.request.content.data;
  console.log('Notification data:', data);

  // Update data if authenticated
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    connect();
  }

  // Navigate to appropriate screen based on notification type
  if (data && data.type === 'message_notification') {
    console.log('Navigating to messages screen');
    
    // If notification contains a specific chat ID, navigate to that chat
    if (data.chatId) {
      router.push({
        pathname: '/chat/[id]',
        params: { id: data.chatId }
      });
    } else {
      // Otherwise navigate to the messages tab
      router.push('/(tabs)/messages');
    }
  }
};
```

### 2. Enhanced Background Notification Handling
Added notification categories and improved handling of notifications when the app is launched from a killed state:

```typescript
// In notificationService.ts - Added notification category for messages
Notifications.setNotificationCategoryAsync('message', [
  {
    identifier: 'view',
    buttonTitle: 'View',
    options: {
      opensAppToForeground: true,
    },
  },
]);

// In sendLocalNotification function - Added category for message notifications
const notificationId = await Notifications.scheduleNotificationAsync({
  content: {
    title: notification.title,
    body: notification.body,
    data: notification.data || {},
    sound: true,
    // Add category for message notifications to enable action buttons
    categoryIdentifier: isMessageNotification ? 'message' : undefined,
    // Add badge count for better visibility
    badge: 1,
  },
  trigger: null, // Send immediately
});
```

### 3. Improved App Launch from Notification
Separated the notification launch check into its own useEffect that depends on authentication state:

```typescript
// Separate effect for checking if app was launched from notification
useEffect(() => {
  const checkLaunchNotification = async () => {
    // Check if app was launched from notification
    const lastNotificationResponse = await Notifications.getLastNotificationResponseAsync();
    if (lastNotificationResponse) {
      console.log('App was opened from notification:', lastNotificationResponse);
      
      // Give app time to initialize before navigation
      setTimeout(() => {
        // Handle notification that launched the app
        handleNotificationResponse(lastNotificationResponse);
      }, 1000);
    }
  };

  if (isAuthenticated) {
    checkLaunchNotification();
  }
}, [isAuthenticated]);
```

### 4. Enhanced Test Script
Updated the test-notifications.js script to support testing different types of notifications:

```javascript
// Test notification types
const NOTIFICATION_TYPES = {
  GENERAL: 'general',
  MESSAGE: 'message_notification',
  SPECIFIC_CHAT: 'specific_chat'
};

// Enhanced sendTestNotification function to support different notification types
async function sendTestNotification(type = NOTIFICATION_TYPES.MESSAGE) {
  // ... notification sending logic
  
  // Add chat ID for specific chat notifications
  if (type === NOTIFICATION_TYPES.SPECIFIC_CHAT) {
    notificationData.title = 'New Message';
    notificationData.body = 'You have received a new message in a chat';
    notificationData.data.chatId = 1; // Replace with an actual chat ID
  } else if (type === NOTIFICATION_TYPES.MESSAGE) {
    notificationData.title = 'New Messages';
    notificationData.body = 'You have new unread messages';
  }
  
  // ... send notification
}
```

## How to Verify the Fix
Use the enhanced test script to verify that the notification system is working correctly:

1. Open the app on your device and ensure you're logged in
2. Look for the console log message "Push token: ExponentPushToken[...]" and copy the token
3. Edit the test-notifications.js script and replace the placeholder values:
   - USER_TOKEN: Your authentication token
   - DEVICE_TOKEN: The Expo push token from step 2
4. Run the script with Node.js to test different notification types:
   - For general notifications: `node test-notifications.js general`
   - For message notifications: `node test-notifications.js message_notification`
   - For specific chat notifications: `node test-notifications.js specific_chat`
5. Check if the notification arrives on your device
6. Test with the app in different states:
   - Foreground: App is open and visible
   - Background: App is open but not visible (e.g., you're in another app)
   - Killed/Terminated: App is completely closed

## Additional Notes
- The server must be properly configured to send push notifications using the Expo push notification service
- For iOS devices, push notifications require a paid Apple Developer account and proper certificates
- For Android devices, ensure the google-services.json file is properly configured and placed in the project root
- When sending notifications from the server, include the appropriate data fields:
  - `type: 'message_notification'` for all message notifications
  - `chatId: <id>` for notifications about specific chats

## Conclusion
With these changes, the app should now be able to receive message notifications in all states: foreground, background, and killed/terminated. The notifications will be properly handled, and the app will navigate to the appropriate screen when a notification is tapped.
