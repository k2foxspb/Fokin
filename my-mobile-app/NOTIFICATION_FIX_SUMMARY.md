# Notification System Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The mobile app was requesting notification permissions correctly, but notifications were not being delivered to the device when messages were received, particularly when the app was not running (killed/terminated state).

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Missing Push Notification Configuration**: The app.json file was missing proper configuration for push notifications, specifically the expo-notifications plugin.
2. **Token Not Sent to Server**: The push token was being generated but not sent to the server, which is necessary for the server to send push notifications to the device.
3. **Incomplete Background Notification Handling**: The app wasn't properly handling notifications when launched from a notification in a killed state.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated app.json Configuration
Added proper push notification configuration to app.json:
- Added the expo-notifications plugin with specific configuration for icon, color, and sounds
- Added googleServicesFile reference for Android FCM support

```json
"plugins": [
  "expo-router",
  "expo-dev-client",
  [
    "expo-notifications",
    {
      "icon": "./assets/images/logo1024.png",
      "color": "#222222",
      "sounds": ["./assets/sounds/notification.wav"]
    }
  ]
],
```

### 2. Enhanced Notification Service
Modified notificationService.ts to send the push token to the server:
- Added a new function `sendPushTokenToServer` that sends the token to the server endpoint
- Updated `registerForPushNotifications` to call this function after obtaining the token

```typescript
export const sendPushTokenToServer = async (token: string): Promise<boolean> => {
  try {
    const userToken = await AsyncStorage.getItem('userToken');
    if (!userToken) {
      console.log('User not authenticated, cannot send push token');
      return false;
    }

    const response = await fetch(`${API_CONFIG.BASE_URL}/api/notifications/register-device/`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'Authorization': `Token ${userToken}`,
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        token: token,
        device_type: Platform.OS,
      }),
    });

    // ... error handling and response processing
    return true;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error sending push token to server:', error);
    return false;
  }
};
```

### 3. Improved Notification Context
Enhanced NotificationContext.tsx to properly handle notifications in all app states:
- Added code to check if the app was launched from a notification
- Created a dedicated function to handle notification responses
- Updated notification listeners to refresh data when notifications are received

```typescript
// Check if app was launched from notification
const lastNotificationResponse = await Notifications.getLastNotificationResponseAsync();
if (lastNotificationResponse) {
  console.log('App was opened from notification:', lastNotificationResponse);
  handleNotificationResponse(lastNotificationResponse);
}
```

## How to Verify the Fix
A test script has been created to verify that the notification system is working correctly:

1. Open the app on your device and ensure you're logged in
2. Look for the console log message "Push token: ExponentPushToken[...]" and copy the token
3. Edit the test-notifications.js script and replace the placeholder values:
   - USER_TOKEN: Your authentication token
   - DEVICE_TOKEN: The Expo push token from step 2
4. Run the script with Node.js: `node test-notifications.js`
5. Check if the notification arrives on your device
6. Test with the app in different states:
   - Foreground: App is open and visible
   - Background: App is open but not visible (e.g., you're in another app)
   - Killed/Terminated: App is completely closed

## Additional Notes
- The server must be properly configured to send push notifications using the Expo push notification service
- For iOS devices, push notifications require a paid Apple Developer account and proper certificates
- For Android devices, ensure the google-services.json file is properly configured and placed in the project root

## Conclusion
With these changes, the app should now be able to receive notifications in all states: foreground, background, and killed/terminated. The notifications will be properly handled, and the app will navigate to the appropriate screen when a notification is tapped.
