## Detailed Changes

### 1. App Icon and Dark Background (app.json)

- Changed userInterfaceStyle from "light" to "dark"
- Added placeholder icon URLs
- Updated adaptiveIcon backgroundColor to "#222222"
- Added notification configuration

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "userInterfaceStyle": "dark",
    "icon": "https://example.com/placeholder-icon.png",
    "android": {
      "adaptiveIcon": {
        "foregroundImage": "https://example.com/placeholder-adaptive-icon.png",
        "backgroundColor": "#222222"
      }
    },
    "notification": {
      "icon": "https://example.com/notification-icon.png",
      "color": "#222222",
      "androidMode": "default",
      "androidCollapsedTitle": "Новые сообщения",
      "iosDisplayInForeground": true
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Notification Service (services/notificationService.ts)

Created a new service with the following functions:
- `requestNotificationPermissions`: Requests permission to send notifications
- `registerForPushNotifications`: Registers the device for push notifications
- `sendLocalNotification`: Sends a local notification
- `addNotificationListener`: Adds a listener for incoming notifications
- `addNotificationResponseListener`: Adds a listener for notification interactions

### 3. NotificationContext Updates (contexts/NotificationContext.tsx)

- Added notification permission handling
- Added push token registration
- Added notification listeners
- Enhanced message handling to detect new messages
- Implemented sending notifications when new messages arrive

## How to Test

1. **App Icon and Dark Theme**
   - The app will now use a dark theme by default
   - The app icon will be displayed with a dark background

2. **Push Notifications**
   - When the app starts, it will request notification permissions
   - When new messages arrive, a notification will be displayed
   - Tapping on the notification will log the interaction (in a real implementation, it would navigate to the messages screen)

## Notes for Real Implementation

In a real implementation, you would need to:
1. Create actual icon files and place them in the assets directory
2. Set up a server to send push notifications
3. Implement navigation to the messages screen when a notification is tapped

The current implementation uses local notifications, which are sufficient for testing but would need to be enhanced for a production app.
